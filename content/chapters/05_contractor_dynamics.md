# Contractor dynamics

Beltway bandits. Hired guns. Leeches. All honorific titles often used for government contractors. Are the negative labels sometimes fair? Certainly. That said, even as the government moves to hire more technical talent into the federal service, contractors continue to provide the largest share of software development in both the federal and civilian sectors. If you are working in the federal service, you need to understand some basic terms about contractors as well as what motivates them and what the federal government contracting market is like for digital/IT services companies.

## Relationships

Government contracting is based largely on the prime/subcontractor relationship. Prime doesn’t mean high quality like it does in the cattle industry. It means that contractor is the contractor that won the bid and is on the hook for delivery to the government. Often, the Prime has to do at least 50% of the work by law or regulation due to a socio-economic status (see below). Most Primes are also Subcontractors (Subs) elsewhere through a process called Teaming. In fact, the entire industry relies on contractors consistently being Primes and Subs for each other - being a Sub is the way many Prime contractors first break into new agencies. This provides a certain level of accountability - you can’t be a bad Prime or a bad Sub and not expect folks to hear about it. Government contracting is a small world. Teaming is a key component of most bids and you should expect any RFP/RFQ that is sent out will have multiple teaming partners contributing to the proposal/quote.

This should matter to you because you can and should know who is part of the team bidding on the work. So, make sure your RFQ/RFP requires folks to identify the teaming partners and requires the Prime to identify what work they plan to have the Subcontractor perform. This allows you to get a clear picture of who is performing what on your contract. Also, Primes often hate this, but get to know the subcontractors as well. If the Prime is confident and good at what they do, they won’t care.

## Socioeconomic Status

The federal government confers special status on certain underrepresented groups of people in government contracting ownership. This allows companies that meet the requirements of a socioeconomic status to win work that is specifically set-aside for small businesses or socioeconomic statuses or to receive direct-awards with no competition for the award. The Small Business Administration provides a pretty helpful overview on this topic.

The four major socioeconomic statuses are:

1. 8(a) Business Development program, or 8a program as it is called, is an ownership/diversity certification conferred by the SBA that lasts for 9 years. 8a companies within the 9 year period can receive direct awards of up to $4m per year for a particular contract.
2. The HUBZone program gives special status to companies incorporated in historically underutilized business zones. Many contracts have HUBZone set-asides to target HUBZone companies.
3. Women-Owned Small Business program confers special status on businesses that are majority owned by women. Every agency has a set-aside spending goal for WOSBs (pronounced WAHZ-bees) to support the Small Business Administration's goal of 5% of all federal contracting spend going to WOSBs.
4. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business program confers special status on majority Services-Disabled Veteran owned businesses. Every single agency has a goal for spend - and several agencies like the Veterans’ Affairs Administration require all spend to go through SDVOSBs.

These programs offer an outstanding way to find up-and-coming and established vendors who meet the requirements in ways that allow you, the federal staff, to reduce the number of competitors for the work. Additionally, many of these communities develop tight-knit relationships between contractors that enable them to team with each other to tackle larger scale contracts.

As you are looking for vendors, you can work with your contracting office to inquire about “set-asides” and “direct awards” to these socioeconomic status businesses. Contracting Officers often have bonuses and performance criteria tied to awarding work to these businesses, and simply being willing to work with these businesses can shorten procurement time and ensure you get qualified vendors with less bids to evaluate. Further, awarding work to these businesses continues the effort to draw in underrepresented groups into the business ownership - and that’s worth supporting.

## Clearances

Depending on your agency, you will have a minimum clearance level contractors have to maintain. There are three clearance levels: confidential, secret, and top secret. There is also something called Public Trust, which is a type of background investigation. Most civilian agencies require Public Trust investigations for all contractors. Clearances are less common in civilian agencies than they are in the Defence and National Security areas. Additionally, every single agency has its own internal process for accepting the clearance or background investigation from other agencies. Just because someone has an active clearance or Public Trust does not mean they are automatically cleared at an agency. Further, some agencies require that all personnel from the contractor be U.S. Citizens.

Your pool of contractors will be affected by these requirements and you must ensure that any procurement meets these requirements. The more stringent, the fewer number of companies that can meet these requirements. Don’t be fooled, however, by large businesses telling you small businesses cannot meet these requirements. They can and do.

Also, your agency has a time period required for clearances in their agency. There are many examples across governments of agencies requiring fast clearances in the RFQ/RFP that do not align with the actual clearance time within the agency. This means that contractors fail to meet the requirements of the contract from day one. No one benefits from this - it creates animosity between the government and the vendor community and it often leads to sub-par contractors who are willing to take the risk to work at those agencies. Always remember: be kind and consider the point of view of the contractor.

## Key Personnel

Nearly every government contract for services requires the naming of key personnel whose past experience meets key requirements for the contract. The government sees this as a way to guarantee that personnel with specific qualifications are bid by companies and that the winning company then staffs the key personnel that were part of the bid. This is the single most misused part of RFPs/RFQs in government. Contractors routinely supply key personnel they do not intend to staff or will staff for only a few months (called a bait and switch). Further, there is generally no contractual requirement to provide a specific person as that borders on a personal services contract and that is generally illegal in the federal government.

So, if you are requesting Key Personnel, the only thing that ensures the contractor staffs that person to your contract is fear of you. Furthermore, substitutions of key personnel are made on the basis of a resume meeting the requirements of the key personnel role. In multiple years of government contracting experience, I’ve seen only one key personnel change request was denied and that was because of a clerical error in the number of years of experience for the individual.

{{< hint info >}}

You need to ensure your Key Personnel have the right experience requirements to deliver what you need. However, you shouldn’t assume you’ll get the person bid into the contract. In fact, focusing on individuals ignores that software development and delivery is a team effort. You’ll also discover that Project and Program Managers are almost always key regardless of the contract type. If you understand modern, digital delivery this will drive you bonkers. Why? Because Project Managers and Program Managers should be empowering teams not serving as the titular head of the project. So, make sure you think clearly about key personnel but don’t put your faith in it ensuring good teams.

## Capture Management

No one wants to be captured. Still, Capture Management is the name of a process within government contracting companies to win work. Many in the digital services community really love to hate on companies for having this role. That doesn’t consider the realities of the government contracting business. Capture Management is just the project management of the process to win work. All companies have sales pipelines. Government contractors are no different. Once leads are narrowed down to opportunities, they can be selected for capture - meaning that the company devotes time and effort to building relationships, understanding the governments challenges, and readying to respond to your request for a proposal. I often want to ask folks who laugh at capture management: how else do you propose government contracting companies obtain information about what the government wants? If you work the procurement process right, the Capture Managers from several companies will understand what you want from them. If you want dumb things, you’ll get dumb things. If you want folks that follow the USDS Playbook, you’ll probably get those kind of responses. That’s all capture management is.

One of the chief ways that digital services folks inside government appear to be raging assholes to government contractors is that they expect govcon companies to know what they want and how they want it without ever talking to them. They also expect govcon companies to transform the way they operate while using antiquated or unclear contracting language. Don’t be an asshole. Open source your procurement strategy - talk openly and often through industry days about the type of contractor you are looking for. Be clear about how you want teams to work and back it up in the RFP. You’ll get better proposals if you do this.

## Proposals

The way you are going to buy services is through some kind of proposal process. The traditional model includes a RFQ with requirements or a Statement of Objectives that requires a written response with a page limit. That response will need to address the requirements or objectives and provide past performance examples. Additionally, there will be pricing involved. This is an entire career field in government contracting. In fact, some of the smartest folks I’ve worked with are Proposal Managers. These proposals often require hours and hours of writing and editing by proposal staff and operations staff - and the win rate is low. This means, many of the proposals you get will have over 500 hours of total work put into them - and you are going to reject most of them. Keep that in mind.

Also, the newest fad in procurement in government is to require oral presentations by technical teams and technical challenges where teams submit working code for evaluation. These are effective screenings - and 18F at GSA can point to ways to do this well - but they require lots and lots of free work by government contracting shops. This is a huge lift for many small businesses and you should keep that in mind as you generate contracts.

Here’s the bottom line: government contracting companies have fairly tight profit margins and have to invest their business development, capture, and proposal teams’ time wisely. If you make outrageous demands, you lower competition and prevent good vendors from bidding. For instance, every single Thanksgiving and Christmas for the past 3 years has been interrupted by federal agencies requiring proposals to be due the Monday after Thanksgiving or the first business day after Christmas. Government contractors have a word for those agencies and their contracting shops. You are going to face those kinds of choices because of urgent needs and tight deadlines - don’t let that be a surprise to your vendors. Brief them often and ask yourself - would I want some agency to interfere with my holidays for a 5% or less chance of winning the work? And recognize that about 5-10 companies will say “not worth it” and you’ll miss out.

## Government Contracting Business

Government contractors are businesses with profit motives. Some are less motivated by that, but nearly all want to make some kind of profit. You must understand that these are services businesses with stiff competition and margins that are very, very thin for really skilled software development work. In my experience, may government contracting officers and program staff have absolutely no idea how the government contracting market works. They do not routinely have to lay off staff due to a lost contract or fire underperforming individuals. Additionally, the number of small businesses that never grow to large businesses in government contracting is astounding. It is a cut-throat world.

If you do nothing else as someone buying contractor services, consider how you can incentivize excellent delivery from your contractor pool. Three easy ways to do this are:

1. Communicate the acquisition strategy early and often to vendors with clear communication about what you want and the type of work you want.
2. Consider human beings when setting proposal deadlines.
3. Don’t be afraid to build relationships and share openly and widely your challenges and visions - and don’t be afraid to try small things in an iterative way.
